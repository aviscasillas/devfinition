## Contributing

Any contribution to this project is more than welcome :relaxed:. 

The main functionality is extremely simple, so contributions are mostly expected to be adding/updating 
**Devfinitions**. You only need to add the corresponding changes into the [devfinitions.json](https://github.com/aviscasillas/devfinition/blob/main/src/data/devfinitions.json) file. When doing so, please try to stick to 1 PR per Devfinition, so review threads will be properly scoped and focused.
